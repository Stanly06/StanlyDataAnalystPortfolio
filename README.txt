**Data Analysis and Data Science Project Portfolio (Code)**

This repository houses the code and resources used in the creation of my portfolio of data analysis and data science projects. Here you will find a collection of my most prominent projects, showcasing my skills and experience in the field of data analytics.

The repository's structure is organized as follows: each project has its own folder that contains the source code, the datasets used, and any other relevant resources. Additionally, there is an image folder that stores screenshots and graphics used in the project documentation. Each project is accompanied by a README.md file that provides a detailed description of the problem addressed, the methods employed, the results obtained, and the steps to execute the code.

The objective of this repository is to showcase my expertise in data analysis and the implementation of data science projects. I hope you find the projects interesting and useful for your own studies or applications. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to contact me. Enjoy exploring the portfolio!
